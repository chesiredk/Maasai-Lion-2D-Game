# Maasai-Lion-2D-Game
I used turtle module to design a 2d navigation game. The character Derrick navigates through horixontal and vertical looking trees bars to reach the lion.
AT which point a reward appears.
I used 3 gifs for the characters, a warrior, a lion and a trophy reward.
It was a simple fun project
Each run, puts the warrior in the begining point and the lion at a random different position.

A sample of a run produces the screen below:

On reaching the reward:
